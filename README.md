# replicating_kn19
A demonstration replicating King &amp; Nielsen (2019), demonstrating that whether the covariates are confounders or mediators is irrelevant.

See the demonstration [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ngreifer/replicating_kn19/blob/master/KandN_replication.html). The function code is in the file misc.R.
